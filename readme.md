# My First COBOL Portfolio Project

## Project Overview

This is a personal COBOL project created to demonstrate my continued proficiency and passion for COBOL programming and mainframe development. It also serves as a portfolio to showcase my understanding of modern software development practices, including version control and project documentation.

This project focuses on [briefly describe what your COBOL program does, e.g., "a simple batch processing application that reads data from a file, performs calculations, and generates a report."].

## Technologies Used

* **COBOL**: The core programming language for this application.
* **GnuCOBOL**: The compiler used to build and test this program in a modern PC environment.
* **JCL**: [Optional, but recommended] A sample JCL script is provided to simulate how this program would be executed on a mainframe system.
* **Git & GitHub**: Used for source code management and version control.
* **Visual Studio Code**: The development environment used for writing and managing the code.

## How to Run the Program

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Paul-COBOL-Dev/COBOL-Portpolio-1.git](https://github.com/Paul-COBOL-Dev/COBOL-Portpolio-1.git)
    ```
2.  **Compile the code using GnuCOBOL:**
    ```bash
    cobc -x -o HELLO HELLO.cbl
    ```
3.  **Execute the program:**
    ```bash
    ./HELLO
    ```
